Angular2 Demo - Pet Store

This is a demo pet store application using angular 2.0 for the front end. The back end is a SpringBoot application located in a separate  repo.
This project is configured for cloud deployment on bluemix.

<h4>SpringBoot Backend</h4>
The angular2 application is independently deployable and completely isolated from the back end server.
That means you can create or own back end in whatever tech you prefer, or you can use my other project: https://github.com/joeydeluca/petstore-server-springboot

<h4>Setup</h4>
The initial setup is borrowed from https://github.com/l2fprod/bluemix-hello-angular2.
